# clown_gamemode
CLOWN is a stealth-based gamemode created for the [SA:MP 0.2.2 modification](http://sa-mp.com/) of GTA:SA

It was created in 2009 by myself using PAWN, a simple C-like scripting language designed for embedded applications.

Inspired by the Splinter Cell series of PC games I set out to bring a similar stealth experience to my favorite multiplayer mod. Hosting up to 100 players in a server, players have the choice between the well-armed Civilian team or the stealthy Clown team who have superior intelligence on enemy locations.

##### Disclaimer: 

This project is very dated. However, I feel it's worth hosting for nostalgia and the fact that it was incredibly fun to create and test. Who knows? Maybe one day it will make a return.
